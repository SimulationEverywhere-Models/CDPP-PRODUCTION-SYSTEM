DEVS Graphs for Top level of ProductionSystem model

Atomic:

Source: for source atomic model
source.h
source.cpp
source.cdd
source.ggaddesigner

productionBuffer: productionBuffer atomic model.
productionBuffer.h
productionBuffer.cpp
productionBuffer.cdd
productionBuffer.ggaddesigner

production: production atomic model.
production.h
production.cpp
production.cdd
production.ggaddesigner

Coupled:
productionSystem.ma: 		a top coupled model contains all atomic models above.

productionSystem.madesigner



register file

ProductioSystem.log:		is a result obtained from running a simulation of the whole system.

ProductioSystemproductioSystem.bat:		 is scripts to execute the model.

productionSystem.avi:				 is a short video of the animation of the simulation

This folder for animate DEVS Graphs of productionSystem. DEVS Graphs of the model created in a separated folder
because if I create madesigner file, it damage the original .ma file and the simulation does not work any more.

the report for this part is included in the term project report "ManufacturingSystem-WIP"
